# Cybersecurity
*Deliverable 1:*

2/7/22

During deliverable 1 I completed 5 units on work. __My goal for this deliverable was to get a nice start on code hs on the cybersecurity unit.__
 __I had a goal and yes I met it becuase I beleive that getting 25% of the whole thing finished is a good amount of time.__ __I have started working with classmates after school like matthew and saif to keep up with the work load in this class and the work load in some other classes.__ The course took me over a review of unit one and in a short spam od time and i reallhy had fun with it figuring out the code and making the code work. An example of the code ive done is down below I had so much fun working on this deliverable and i am happy to keep working.
 
 ```// Write your code here
function start(){
var travelList = ["Japan", "Ireland", "Turkey", "Aquaba"];

println(travelList[2]);
}
```
