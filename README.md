# Cybersecurity
*Deliverable 1:*

2/7/22

During deliverable 1 I completed 5 units on work. __My goal for this deliverable was to get a nice start on code hs on the cybersecurity unit.__
 __I had a goal and yes I met it becuase I beleive that getting 25% of the whole thing finished in a week.__ __I have started working with classmates after school like matthew and saif to keep up with the work load in this class and the work load in some other classes.__ The course took me over a review of semester ones coding class and in a short spam of time. I really had fun with it figuring out the code and making the code work. An example of the code ive done is down below I had so much fun working on this deliverable and i am happy to keep working.
 
 ```// Write your code here
function start(){
var travelList = ["Japan", "Ireland", "Turkey", "Aquaba"];

println(travelList[2]);
}
```
*Deliverable 2:*

During deliverable 2 I completed a little bit of my website. My goal for this deliverable is to get the website layout and looks of the website to look amazing. I beleive that I did complete my goal. __My work schedule is that I will be working on my website and alternating between code hs. I am trying to make a good quiz on my website and might need help with it so I might ask how to make a quiz.__ The website should take me sometime to make but I am happy enough to get it started and to learn even more about it. I think alternate from the website and code hs will help me stay ahead. 

My Screen Castify is in class room.

 My Goal for deliverable 3 was to focus on the production of my website, I met this goal becuase I focused more on add information onto my website. The website looks really good now and using the code I have been using I excpet it to look really well. I need to have motivation to keep working on the website and using the code.
 
 my code example is below:
```<h3 style="text-align: center;">What is Cybersecurity? </h3>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Definition: Protection of computer, systems, and data from digital attacks.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Cybersecurity and the Internet of Things </h3>
```

*Deliverable 4*

Deliverable 4: I worked on my website some more i started to drift away from code hs becuase the deadline of the webite was coming and I dont know how to make a quiz using javascript. SO i deided to add in mor einformation that I can use to my advantage and have more information that people can look for in my website I foundout that aligning all my text made everything look so much better. My goal is to find out a way to have my quiz be included in my project. I foundout that I have completed evrything in seminar and will present my informtation to people when they come see me. I think being persistent with finding a way to get.

```.topnav a {
