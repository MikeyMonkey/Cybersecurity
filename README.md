# Cybersecurity
*Deliverable 1:*

2/7/22

During deliverable 1 I completed 5 units on work. __My goal for this deliverable was to get a nice start on code hs on the cybersecurity unit.__
 __I had a goal and yes I met it becuase I beleive that getting 25% of the whole thing finished in a week.__ __I have started working with classmates after school like matthew and saif to keep up with the work load in this class and the work load in some other classes.__ The course took me over a review of semester ones coding class and in a short spam of time. I really had fun with it figuring out the code and making the code work. An example of the code ive done is down below I had so much fun working on this deliverable and i am happy to keep working.
 
 ```// Write your code here
function start(){
var travelList = ["Japan", "Ireland", "Turkey", "Aquaba"];

println(travelList[2]);
}
```
*Deliverable 2:*

During deliverable 2 I completed a little bit of my website. My goal for this deliverable is to get the website layout and looks of the website to look amazing. I beleive that I did complete my goal. __My work schedule is that I will be working on my website and alternating between code hs. I am trying to make a good quiz on my website and might need help with it so I might ask how to make a quiz.__ The website should take me sometime to make but I am happy enough to get it started and to learn even more about it. I think alternate from the website and code hs will help me stay ahead. 

My Screen Castify is in class room.
